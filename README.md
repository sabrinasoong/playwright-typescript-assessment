# SDET Technical Test

## Overview

This project is for a take home assessment for a SDET Technical Test.  
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to write Playwright and Typescript automation tests.

1. Navigate to London Stock Exchange website
2. Display FTE 100's top 10 constituents with highest percentage change as a CSV file
3. Display FTE 100's top 10 constituents with lowest percentage change as a CSV file
4. Display FTE 100's constituents with market cap of over 7 million
5. Determines which month over the past 3 years has the lowest average index value
